# sculpture_survey

A giant "singing" sculpture is about to tour Nigeria to promote the science of acoustics. The project coordinators and funders want to survey the people who viewed the sculpture.

To do this the funders require a Python application running on a nearby PC that viewers of the sculpture can use to fill in a form with their name, demographics (age, sex, ethnicity, disabled status, etc), and whether they (a) enjoyed the sculpture, (b) were curious as to how it worked and (c) wanted to know more about science as a result.

Create an application with an attractive graphical user interface to enable viewers of the sculpture to complete and submit this form. The application should ideally be attractively presented and accessible e.g. with images, suitable colors and fonts, and a range of UI controls.

All data apart from the name must be amenable to a numerical representation for possible statistical evaluation, for examole if people are asked if they enjoyed the sculpture, the could choose from 1 Strongly Agree, 2 Agree, 3 Neither Agree, 4 Disagree or 5 Strongly Disagree (i.e. a Likert scale).

Ideally the application should include error checking, for example if a non-numerical age is entered how will you test for it and how will you deal with the error?

For higher marks the application should include a separate tab page or window so that the hosts of the application can viiew a list of the sculpture viewers'names and the answers they submitted. The hosts should be able to see statistical values associated with the data. For example, the average age, number of women who liked the sculpture, standard deviation, etc. The application could also put the hosts page behind a password as you wouldn't want the sculpture viewers to see this.

The code should also be well commented with the comments explaining what key lines or sections of code do with appropriately clear, concise and technical language.
